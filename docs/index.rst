Enable Auto-Login on Supported Devices
On many devices, once you've logged in for the first time, you’ll have the option to enable automatic login. This will save your credentials securely on the device, allowing you to access your Paramount Plus TV account without having to enter your details every time.

Use a Strong but Memorable Password
Make sure your password is secure, but also easy for you to remember. A combination of upper and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols is ideal. However, avoid overly complicated passwords that are difficult to recall.

Update the App Regularly
To avoid login issues and ensure that you’re taking advantage of the latest features, make sure to update your Paramount Plus app regularly. App updates often fix bugs, improve performance, and enhance security, ensuring a faster and smoother sign-in experience.

Ensure Your Internet Connection Is Stable
A slow or unstable internet connection can sometimes hinder the login process. Before signing in, ensure that your internet connection is strong and stable. A reliable Wi-Fi or Ethernet connection can make logging into your Paramount Plus TV account much quicker.

Log Out After Use on Shared Devices
If you’re using a shared device (e.g., a family computer or public device), always log out after you're finished. This will help protect your personal information and prevent unauthorized access to your account.
